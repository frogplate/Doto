# Doto
A [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) command line application written in Typescript and Deno.

It is being developed both as a way to try out TypeScript and Deno, and also because I need a todo.txt Windows application that supports the recurring and hidden task [extensions in Simpletask](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/index.en.md).

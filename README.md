# Doto
A [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) command line application written in Typescript and Deno.

It is being developed both as a way to try out TypeScript and Deno, and also because I need a todo.txt Windows application that supports the recurring and hidden task extensions in Simpletask.

The todo.txt file format is [here](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

The todo.txt CLI commands are defined [here](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/wiki/Usage).

The Simpletask extensions are documented [here](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/index.en.md)
